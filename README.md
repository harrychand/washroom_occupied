# washroom_occupied
washroom occupancy indicator

Washroom Occupancy Indicator is a devices use to indicate if the washroom is occupied and user need to wait outside of the washroom or use another nearby washroom 
this devices use Arduino Nano as platform to control the Ultrasonic sensor and indicate via NeoPixar Indicator. 

items required :  
1. Arduino Nano 
2. Arduino Nano shield 
3. Ultrasonic sensor (Min 1, Max 4)
4. LED (depend on the number of ultrasonic sensors)
5. NeoPixel Addressable LED Ring-16 LED
6. 500 ohm Resistor (for LED)
7. wiring & soldering equitment. 


Setup Instruction : 
1. get ready all the items above 
2. attach Arduino Nano on Arduino Nano shiled 
3. Open Arduino IDE and 
4. upload toilet_vacant_indicator1 
5. modified the code if the component and connection are difference from the layout 
6. Upload the code to Arduino Nano
7. setup the projects based on the layout below
8. power on Arduino Nano
9. Test and observed the results
